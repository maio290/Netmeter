# Netmeter

I wrote this tool in order to make it easier for people to find issues regarding their internet-connection.
Since their are many different types of routers on the market, you may have to change the the internal IP addresses. 

Their is a lot to do and improve.

Usage:

Just start the *.exe file -> done. 

Current Settings:

Timeout == 1000 ms
Internal IP 1 = localhost
Internal IP 2 = 192.168.178.1 (usually used by fritz.box)
External IP 1 = maio290.de
External IP 2 = German Google-Server.

//TODO:

-> Let the user change the IPs.
-> Use a config file.
-> Make a new tab for settings.
-> Generally improve code.
